                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>I'm a sophomore at USC studying computer science and business administration. As you can probably tell by the look of this site, I haven't gotten too far into the computer science part yet.</p>

                <p>(I took a year off between freshman and sophomore year because classes were online. I interned full time.)</p>

                <h3>Involvment and Interests</h3>

                <p>I'm currently President of the USC Value Investing Group, USC's premier club focused on investment research and analysis. It is the most selective financial organization on campus.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, reading, watching standup comedy, and following Philadelphia sports. I specifically enjoy rereading <em>Meditations</em> whenever the Sixers choke in the playoffs.</p>

                <h3>Honors and Test Scores</h3>

                <p>I'm a half-tuition Presidential Scholar at USC because I was a National Merit Scholar, and I was named one of 3600 U.S. Presidential Scholar Candidates in 2019 because I got a perfect score on the ACT. I was also third in my high school grad class of 517, but nobody else knew because that's the first number that they don't announce at graduation.</p>
